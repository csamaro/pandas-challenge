In this module we are given data from different schools pertaining to students' math and reading results.
First we collected and analyzed the data as a whole for the district.
Then, we looked at each school's individual data in each field and drew some conclusions
.
From the analysis made we can determine that:
    Charter schools have a higher overall passing percentage (the top five all being charter schools).
    A school with more than 2000 students has a lower overall passing percentage than one with less.
    The average math and reading scores were the hightest when the spending range was less than 585 dollars.
